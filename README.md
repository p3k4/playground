# playground - python

Maybe I should work on Python again, since it's rather new and popular language, sure - but it's always fun to make stuff, and I see potential for it to make Java rather useless down the line. The uni. NTNU here in Norway is pushing python as their "go to" language for newcomers to scripting. I see they have a playlist for the basics, and I'll pick up a e-book. Shame I don't have any beer or psychedelics around - I've found most intoxications makes great coding-companions.

First issue was importing the turtle library. First lesson from NTNU in their vid found here: https://bit.ly/3qEjFJj was to draw a circle using the turtle lib. 
That function had to be fetched from the following package: python3-tkinter.x86_64
Wonder why the Masters of NTNU couldn't includ a similar solution in their introduction vid.

In next vid. "Stine" shows up with her colorful approach, making it clear python runs line-by-line.
She tought me enough to make somewhat of a color-palette, or an inverted rainbow if you'd like:

Oh my, I'm making flowers now. It's the feeling you get playing as Enchantress in dota 2, each move makes you slightly more liberal, and you just wanna buy a Dagon to end the game early. https://ibb.co/hxGTgp2 Soo far, I'm glad I allready know most of the basics of programming. Python seems like a great start for newcomers indeed. I remember missing some visual "bloom" learning my first dedicated programing-language; Javascript.
