Maybe I should work on Python again, since it's rather new and popular language, sure - but it's always fun to make stuff, and I see potential for it to make Java rather useless down the line. The uni. NTNU here in Norway is pushing python as their "go to" language for newcomers to scripting. I see they have a playlist for the basics, and I'll pick up a e-book. Shame I don't have any beer or psychedelics around - I've found most intoxications makes great coding-companions.

First issue was importing the turtle library. First lesson from NTNU in their vid found here: https://bit.ly/3qEjFJj was to draw a circle using the turtle lib. 
That function had to be fetched from the following package: python3-tkinter.x86_64
Wonder why the Masters of NTNU couldn't includ a similar solution in their introduction vid.
