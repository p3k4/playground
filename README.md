Maybe I should work on Python again, since it's rather new and popular language, sure - but it's always fun to make stuff, and I see potential for it to make Java rather useless down the line. The uni. NTNU here in Norway is pushing python as their "go to" language for newcomers to scripting. I see they have a playlist for the basics, and I'll pick up a e-book. Shame I don't have any beer or psychedelics around - I've found most intoxications makes great coding-companions.
