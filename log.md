Maybe I should work on Python again, since it's rather new and popular language, sure - but it's always fun to make stuff, and I see potential for it to make Java rather useless down the line. The uni. NTNU here in Norway is pushing python as their "go to" language for newcomers to scripting. I see they have a [playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6jkSKRjCE&list=PLrIC8MB5SE_HY4zKDCYUAz4ugAXZMgQ3z&index=2) for the basics, and I'll pick up a e-book. Shame I don't have any beer around - I've found most intoxications makes great coding-companions!

First issue was importing the turtle library. First lesson from NTNU in their vid found here: https://bit.ly/3qEjFJj was to draw a circle using the turtle lib. 
That function had to be fetched from the following package: python3-tkinter.x86_64
Wonder why the Masters of NTNU couldn't includ a similar solution in their introduction vid.

In next vid. "Stine" shows up with her colorful approach, making it clear python runs line-by-line.
She tought me enough to make somewhat of a color-palette, or an inverted rainbow if you'd like:

Oh my, I'm making flowers now. It's the feeling you get playing as Enchantress in dota 2, each move makes you slightly more liberal, and you just wanna buy a Dagon to end the game early. https://ibb.co/hxGTgp2 Soo far, I'm glad I allready know most of the basics of programming. Python seems like a great start for newcomers indeed. I remember missing some visual "bloom" learning my first dedicated programing-language; Javascript.

Look, it's not like I wish I had studied informatics back at [HIÃ˜ (Uni where I studied IT)](https://www.hiof.no/english/), or taken a more the more system-development approach. If anything I'd be a computer-engineer, though my mathskills are do-able, its mostly somwhere around garbage and absolute shite. What I lack in such cognitive skills, I make up in presentation and social skills I imagine. Not very common among those who also code, in my experience coders are generaly along the lines of chess-players: We hate to lose and fail, stubborn as hell - and if you make us tilt, we'll never forget your winning move and curse it to the day we go permanently afk. Not the type of person you'd wanna share lunch with, for good reason. Even back in your playgroup, took me half my life to figure that one out.

It's my attention span, for "daily tasks" it's way shorter than others - as a clear benefit to us with adhd, I can hyperfocus! Its completly random, but when it hits it's deadly accurate. Give me any one issue, task, a ping-pong ball or a rock; I'm gonna nail it to the target as if it were sendt from God! On the other hand, give me two tasks to be solved at the same time, and I'm off chasing the third before I've even started. Rather comical, just don't mistake me for a clown, even if I do that myself sometimes.

Like, this stuff gets me distracted, alot and often. The next vieo in the playlist, NTNU decides to take a full turn in their missleading video-description. The video is about user-input, instead we're making a penicle - which they call a star on multiple occations. It's not OCD (haven't got that on my list) - it's distracting! First it's a rainbow, ok fine let's make a bloody rainbow then. Flowers - "a shite, well I really wanna learn so let's do it". Now, they've dragged religion into it, all because they literally couldn't tell right from left in their code!

The previous lesson reminded me that I have a playlist dedicated those who want to learn to listen to Black metal. It's a skill, and I can't help but picture Satyricons album "Volcano" when scripting in Python. Seems fitting, I'll just share the [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Y5FO9yQ5VOOFSW3CQm69V)

Made some coffe to help me through the night and made it through their 8th video. Got me stuck for a bit, not because of the chellenge they gave. That was just fun. I couldn't get rid of the distraction it gave. That's exctly how it works with adhd. You have to deal with disctrations, often and alot! Doesn't make it easy over time at all, it's always difficult! When people deliberately makes us distracted because it's a funny reaction, it's like throwing gas at the fire. First it's a "Woa" thing, "my god, look at those flames!". Then, it takes a while for the burning to settle. A long time. Judging by the last note, just about an hour.

Their 9th vid. Was cool, haven't seen casting for a while (yes, phun intended).
Added more .py files to the repo. And wonder if I should keep it to the [NTNU playlist](https://bit.ly/3KhEhz3) for tonight, shouldn't mess up my sleeping shedule too much doctor says. On the other hand, I did end up finding a [Python E-book](https://bit.ly/3nBQvsk). There were others, though they didn't seem to do much of a dive. Jep, let's finish the playlist first.

if-elif-else. If I remember correctly, I remember learning "there's no else if", well - seems now there is. Here's my thoughts after seeing their 10th video: Turtle lib. is well-suited for kids to learn the most basics of programing, as all languages should have a playfull, well, playground. We did it lads, we're indeed making babysteps, neato! Just, don't kick the baby, not just yet - and keep the water for the next one. Flowcharts, oh my - that's my favorite invention! I gotta say I'm starting to like this girl "Stine". Just, don't ever put music in your vid. girl - it's messing up humans best discovery yet: My own bloody music!

Done more "turtleing", by that I mean drawing with Python and, trying to calculate the correct measurements for a shape called The Unicursal hexagram which I decided to draw before I got to bed last night. Found loads of fuzzy-wuzzy-ooh-magix-stuff online about the figure, I remember seeing it first back in high school - figured I could draw it as I'm starting to make slightly wider babysteps using the library. Yesterday/last night was real fun - didn't sleep much in the end and decided to get up around 7 this morning to pick up where I left off. Luckly, I had coffee. Currently I'm fine with the result. The shape is so that, every one calculation affects the entirety of other calculations - as it is unicursal (drawn in using one movement). 

The [code](https://github.com/p3k4/playground/blob/main/hex.py) and [screenshot](https://ibb.co/wsqDBZ9)

That unicursal hexagram is messing with my head, those 30 degree agles to be exact. In the [hex.py](https://github.com/p3k4/playground/blob/main/hex.py)-file there's a possible solution in the comment section, using sin and cos to find coordinates based on a radius which touches the outer angles of the figure. I don't know much about sin or cos, but I did get to assign values to variables after using the formulas. Well, when done on paper, I meassured lengths of the lines, and those aren't the same at all! This is very odd, as I was going the "all lines had to be the same length" direction.
[A calculator](https://rechneronline.de/pi/unicursal-hexagram.php) I found spits out some magic-numbers, I'll have a look on those tomorrow. gn

I've found loads of [Python-assignments online](https://oppgaver.kidsakoder.no/python), wirting [my name](https://github.com/p3k4/playground/blob/main/navn.py) was the very first one. Of course the r's are written in uppercase and wouldn't usually be correct. Oh well. What supriced me is that if you wanna make a circle, drawn clockwise - the circles radius has to be written as a nagetive number. like this; circle(-25). I'll continue doing those, and sometime later make progress
in the playlist NTNU had. Seems they want us to make a "snake" game in one of their final videoes. Thing is, I don't wanna do that yet, before I get comfortable doing the most basic stuff.

Next task was to write the first letter in my name as "double sized" with inner color fill. I decided to do my full name once again, just to practice even more - and also, it's ton of fun! Soo far I've made "Per Chris". Here's the [file](https://github.com/p3k4/playground/blob/main/navn_2.py), I'll upload the final and finished one tomorrow morning as a seperate file. Now, I wanna lay back and watch some episodes of "Mr. Robot" before bedtime.

Soo, circles. I'm trying to get a hold on how to calculate them properly - I've uplaoded my second attemnt on making a joyfull smurf in turtle (still using python). I'm thinking about going back to scratch once again, though. It gets rather diffucult to focus doing it all in one go - and in between every attempt I do make progress.It's no wonder we make kids draw houses and horses in their playgroup, those things are quite simple. Hm, I can still make an "Iron Maiden" drawing..! Yes, good idea, or even better - Kiss! Kiss makeup, haha! xd

-- log Sat 27. 00:45

Haha, brilliant idea - I followed up and made [this](https://github.com/p3k4/playground/blob/main/kiss.py) - Gene, or - "Mr. Evil-incarnated", hilarious!

I've slept all day soo, haven't done much at all. [Made a cow](https://github.com/p3k4/playground/blob/main/cow.py) though, moo! xd

-- log Fri 28. 00:30

I just couldn't help myself, that cow needed some [friends](https://github.com/p3k4/playground/blob/main/dyr.py)

-- log Fri 28. 03:40

Added more animals to [dyr.py](https://github.com/p3k4/playground/blob/main/dyr.py)
