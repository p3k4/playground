# playground - python

Maybe I should work on Python again, since it's rather new and popular language, sure - but it's always fun to make stuff, and I see potential for it to make Java rather useless down the line. The uni. NTNU here in Norway is pushing python as their "go to" language for newcomers to scripting. I see they have a playlist for the basics, and I'll pick up a e-book. Shame I don't have any beer or psychedelics around - I've found most intoxications makes great coding-companions.

First issue was importing the turtle library. First lesson from NTNU in their vid found here: https://bit.ly/3qEjFJj was to draw a circle using the turtle lib. 
That function had to be fetched from the following package: python3-tkinter.x86_64
Wonder why the Masters of NTNU couldn't includ a similar solution in their introduction vid.

In next vid. "Stine" shows up with her colorful approach, making it clear python runs line-by-line.
She tought me enough to make somewhat of a color-palette, or an inverted rainbow if you'd like:

Oh my, I'm making flowers now. It's the feeling you get playing as Enchantress in dota 2, each move makes you slightly more liberal, and you just wanna buy a Dagon to end the game early. https://ibb.co/hxGTgp2 Soo far, I'm glad I allready know most of the basics of programming. Python seems like a great start for newcomers indeed. I remember missing some visual "bloom" learning my first dedicated programing-language; Javascript.

Look, it's not like I wish I had studied informatics back at Hi√∏ (uni), or taken a more the more system-development approach. If anything I'd be a computer-engineer, though my mathskills are do-able, its mostly somwhere around garbage and absolute shite. What I lack in such cognitive skills, I make up in presentation and social skills I imagine. Not very common among those who also code, in my experience coders are generaly along the lines of chess-players: We hate to lose and fail, stubborn as hell - and if you make us tilt, we'll never forget your winning move and curse it to the day we go permanently afk. Not the type of person you'd wanna share lunch with, for good reason. Even back in your playgroup, took me half my life to figure that one out.

It's my attention span, for "daily tasks" it's way shorter than others - as a clear benefit to us with adhd, I can hyperfocus! Its completly random, but when it hits it's deadly accurate. Give me any one issue, task, a ping-pong ball or a rock; I'm gonna nail it to the target as if it were sendt from God! On the other hand, give me two tasks to be solved at the same time, and I'm off chasing the third before I've even started. Rather comical, just don't mistake me for a clown.
